You can use these code to understand basic servers with Golang.

You can add different redirection routes to the .yaml file in the format given in this file.

If the current path does not match with any of the paths in the .yaml file, program redirects to fallback address which you can change in the main.go file.

More info in the comments.

NOTE : I wrote this in a LINUX machine.
